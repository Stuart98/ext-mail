# Ext Mail

Ext Mail is a GMail clone example application built with the Ext JS framework's Classic toolkit to demonstrate how complex applications can be built with the framework.

This application was demonstrated during a 3-part **Sencha Cafe webinar series** where it was built live by [Stuart Ashworth](https://www.stuartashworth.com).

**The application is part of the [Ext JS: The Ultimate Guide](https://www.stuartashworth.com/ultimate-guide) book where it is extended further to make use of more advanced features and components.**

**You can get access to the full book and all of the examples and sample applications by visiting https://www.stuartashworth.com/ultimate-guide**
